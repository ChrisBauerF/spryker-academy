                    <h1>Product Management</h1>
                    <p>Product data is central data for shops. It contains characteristics that describe the product as well as characteristics that define their appearance in the shop. For example, the color of a product is an important information that the customer might need, whereas the weight of the product is needed to calculate delivery costs of a product. Likewise this information is very relevant for search behavior and eventually influences the conversion rate of customers in the shop.

Typically, product data is maintained and enriched in an external Product Information Management (PIM) system. As soon as all characteristics are gathered, they can be imported to <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span>. The incoming product data must be transformed into the project specific data structure and is then persisted. After persisting the product data, the data is exported to Redis and Elasticsearch. Redis is used to store product data for performance reasons. Elasticsearch, on the other hand, is responsible for search. This way, Yves can access the relevant product data very fast. As your imported product data will most probably not have the ideal content, we offer you product management tools to enrich your product data before your product gets into the shop frontend.

</p>
                    <h2>Product Hierarchies
</h2>
                    <h3>Abstract and Concrete Products (Variants)
</h3>
                    <p><span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span>’s data structure for products allows to design a product hierarchy, which Yves relies on to display products in the correct way. Every product consists of an abstract product and one or more concrete products, also called variants. Your customers cannot buy an abstract product. The item that can be put into cart is always the concrete product.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example</strong>: </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        <img src="../resources/images/product_variants.png" title="Prodcut Variants" alt="Product Variants" class="Thumbnail" />
                    </p>
                    <p>

 

Imagine your product is a shoe. This shoe comes in three different sizes, namely 40, 41, and 42. Now technically you could have 3 different standalone products with three product detail pages. From a customer perspective this is unnecessary overhead, especially considering that a product catalog should not display three times a product that will most likely look identical. From a product management perspective, the same product would have to be created three times with the only difference being the size.

</p>
                    <h3>Differentiate between abstract and concrete products
</h3>
                    <p>In <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span>, both abstract and concrete products have an SKU, name, description, price, product attributes, and media assets. This information, besides the SKU, is inherited from the abstract to the concrete products when they are created. However, only the concrete product has stock and may have one or more additional attributes that we call super attributes (In the example above the super attribute is the size). This structure allows to create multiple variants of a product, which eventually are the products that your customers buy.

</p>

                    <h3>
Product Hierarchy in the <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span> Demoshop
</h3>
                    <p>In the catalog of the shop frontend abstract products are listed (e.g. shoe model X blue). Once the customer has selected one of these abstract products and proceeded to the product detail page, the abstract products information is displayed first. Only after having selected the distinctive characteristic of a variant (e.g. size 41 for the shoe in the example above) the concrete product information is displayed (e.g. shoe model X color = blue size = 41). Note that the structure of the products is a business decisions and that both, abstract and concrete products, share the same URL in the <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span> demoshop.

</p>
                    <h2>Attribute Management
</h2>
                    <p>Creating and managing product attributes is the first step in enriching your product data. It is an essential part of maintaining and improving the online shop for your customers. Attributes can serve different purposes and are therefore stored in different ways. They may be used not only for product management, but also to improve search and filter functionality in the shop.

</p>
                    <h3>Product Attribute Management
</h3>
                    <p>In Zed, product management attributes support creating and editing products. You can add keys for your attribute name and values, enabling the translation to different languages (localized). Multiple ways of handling translations are offered. The following examples highlight the use cases.

</p>
                    <div class="example" style="background-color: #dcdcdc;"><strong>Example 1 for localized attributes and non-localized values</strong>:

<br />In a shop with two languages Product Y exists with an attribute “weight” and an attribute values is “63.5 g”. Translations are only necessary for the attribute name and not the attribute value in this case. 

<br /><br />In the DB a key “attribute.weight” is saved. The key can now be translated into different languages via the glossary: 

<br /><br />Key = attribute.weight 
<br />Value (en_EN) = Weight <br />Value (de_DE) = Gewicht 

<br /><br />The attribute value “63.5 g” exists as a value-key and serves as a key and a value at the same time in the DB:<br /><br />

Value (non-localized)=63.5 g 
<br />What you see on the English version of the shop: Weight = 63.5 g 
<br />What you see on the German version of the shop: Gewicht = 63.5 g
</div>
                    <div class="example" style="background-color: #dcdcdc;"><strong>Example 2 for localized attributes and values</strong>:

<br />In a shop with two languages Product X exists with an attribute “Protection Feature” and an attribute value “waterproof”. Both, attribute name and value need translations. 

<br /><br />In the DB a key “attribute.protection_feature” is saved. The key can be translated into different languages via the glossary: 

<br /><br />Key = attribute.protection_feature <br />Value (en_EN) = Protection Feature 
<br />Value (de_DE) = Schutzfunktion 

<br /><br />The attribute value “waterproof” is now translated, a non-localized value (as in Example 1) is not sufficient: 

<br /><br />Value (en_EN) = Waterproof 
<br />Value (de_DE) = Wasserdicht 

<br /><br />What you see on the English version of the shop: 
<br />Protection Feature = Waterproof 

<br /><br />What you see on the German version of the shop: 
<br />Schutzfunktion = Wasserdicht
</div>
                    <div class="example" style="background-color: #dcdcdc;"><strong>Example 3 for different localized attributes and values for different languages</strong><![CDATA[

]]><br />Product Z has the attribute “length” and is sold in 3 countries, Germany, Ireland, and the United States. Due to the fact that the United States does not use the metric system, the attribute values should be displayed in feet in the US and in meters in Germany and Ireland. 

<br />For this scenario there are two ways of doing it. One way (1) is to work with a non-localized attribute key for Germany and Ireland, and a localized key for the US, because (like in Example 1) two languages could share the same translation for the attribute. The other way (2) is to add localized attribute keys and values for each language. <br /><br /><strong>(1)Non-Localized key and localized key for the US 

</strong><br />In the DB a key “attribute.length” is saved for non-localized values and a localized key “attribute.length.us” for the translations in the metric system. 

<br /><br />Key = attribute.length <br />
Value (en_IE) = Length 
<br />Value (de_DE) = Länge 

<br /><br />Key = attribute.length.us 
<br />Value (en_US) = Length 

<br /><br />Now for each of the attribute keys we add the attribute values, which are 1.5 meter for the Ireland and Germany, and 4.92 feet for the US. 

<br /><br />For the key “attribute.length” the value is: 
<br />Value = 1.5 meter 

<br /><br />For the key “attribute.length.us” the value is: <br />Value = 4.92 feet <br /><br /><strong>
(2)Localized keys for US, DE and IE 

</strong><br />In the DB three localized keys, namely “attribute.length.de”, “attribute.length.ie”, and “attribute.length.us” are saved. 

<br /><br />Key = attribute.length.de 
<br />Value (de_DE) = Länge 

<br /><br />Key = attribute.length.ie 
<br />Value (en_IE) = Length 

<br /><br />Key = attribute.length.us 
<br />Value (en_US) = Length 

<br /><br />Now for each of the attribute keys we add the attribute values. 

<br /><br />For the key “attribute.length.de” the value is: 
<br />Value = 1.5 meter 

<br /><br />For the key “attribute.length.ie” the value is: 
<br />Value = 1.5 meter 

<br /><br />For the key “attribute.length.us” the value is: 
<br />Value = 4.92 feet 

<br /><br />What you see on the Irish and German versions of the shop: 
<br />Length = 1.5 meter 
<br />Länge = 1.5 meter 

<br /><br />What you see on the US version of the shop: <br />Length = 4.92 feet
</div>
                    <h3>Attributes in the PIM
</h3>
                    <p>Translations for the attribute values in the PIM are optional and users may add new values in the process of creating a new product in the PIM. The input type ranging from text input to numerical values can be defined upfront. Adding new attribute values in the product creation process can be disabled, thereby restricting the user to the predefined value. All attributes that appear in the attribute management are called declared attributes.

</p>
                    <h3>What are “declared” attributes?
</h3>
                    <p>Declared attributes are the attributes that can be used in the PIM. There are two ways of declaring an attribute. On the one hand, when you create a new attribute it is automatically declared and can then be used for creating products in the PIM. On the other hand, you may import products with existing attributes in JSON format. The imported attributes are displayed in the PIM, but cannot be edited. Only after adding the exact same attribute key to the list of attributes in the attribute management, it becomes available in the PIM.

</p>
                    <h3>What are super attributes?
</h3>
                    <p>The <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span> product data model allows for the creation of multiple variants of one product. For the shop to be able to differentiate between these variants some characteristic needs to differ between them. A super attribute must be added to every product variant in order to display multiple variants of an abstract product in the shop frontend (Unless there is only one variant, which makes the use of super attributes for differentiation purposes obsolete). Attributes become super attributes by marking them as such in the attribute management interface. Important to note is that the variants do not need to share the same super attributes in order to belong to the same abstract product. Here is are two examples:

</p>
                    <p>(1) Abstract product X has concrete product A and B: A: Super attribute = (color:blue) B: Super attribute = (color:green)

</p>
                    <p>(2) Abstract product Y has concrete products C and D: C: Super attribute = (color:red) D: Super attribute = (size: 45)</p>
                    <h3>

Super attributes in the <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span> Demoshop
</h3>
                    <p>In this example on the product detail page there will be the possibility to select either the attribute color or the attribute size. For a variant to be selectable, it should have a unique combination of values for its super attributes compared to the other variants from the same abstract product.

]]></h3>
                    <p>In <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span> products can be imported or created with the PIM. Creating the product with the PIM starts by defining an abstract product with all its information and then to go on to creating the different variants of this product. This workflow exists because the concrete products initially inherit some information from the abstract product. All information may be translated to different languages in the creation process. Make sure that the attribute management is handled in advance, because the creation of variants will not be possible without super attributes. All in all, the following pieces of information can be edited and translated in the creation process out of the box.

</h3>
                    <p>Both, abstract and concrete products have an SKU as a means to identify them. In the backoffice UI you may add an SKU as you like in the first step in the field “SKU prefix”. The SKUs for your concrete products are currently generated by adding super attribute data to the SKU prefix.

</p>
                    <h3>Price &amp; Taxes
</h3>
                    <p>The abstract as well as the concrete product has a price. If the concrete product does not have a price, then it will be inherited from the abstract product. Later, they may be changed for the different variants. In the Spryler demoshop, prices in the catalog as well as on the product detail pages, before having selected a variant, belong to the abstract product.

Taxes, however, are only attached to the abstract product. They can be managed in the tax UI in Zed. Only those tax sets that have been created there can be assigned to the abstract product. All concrete products of one abstract product share the same tax set. The taxes show in <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span> demoshop for every calculation.

                    <h3>Stock
</h3>
                    <p>Stock may be managed per defined warehouse in the PIM on the level of each concrete product. The option that a product “is never out of stock” is also available. Stock is not displayed in the frontend of the <span class="GeneralProductName">Spryker OS</span> demoshop, but could.

                    <h3>
Product Attributes / Variants
</h3>
                    <p>As described in the attribute management part of this documentation, the attributes available in the PIM must be declared upfront. Those that have been imported, but are not declared yet cannot be edited, however, those stay with the product. Regular attributes are added to products for the purpose of displaying this information in the shop and if needed for the purpose of managing search and filter preferences. Attributes that are inherited from the abstract product to the concrete product can be overwritten in the concrete product. If attributes for the concrete product are defined, then they will overwrite the attributes from the abstract product.

</p>
                    <p>If it’s overwritten and you modify this information in the abstract product, it will not be updated in the concrete product anymore.

</p>
                    <h3>Image Sets
</h3>
                    <p>For abstract as well as concrete products you can add product image sets. One image set is one or more images that can be used in a set to be displayed for different purposes. For example one image set may be displayed in the product detail page, another image set could solely be used for marketing purposes elsewhere.
</p>

                    <h3>URL
</h3>
                    <p>The URL is created after activation and cannot be changed in the UI. Changing the URLs is only possible in the database, but consider that each URL is unique.

</p>
                    <h2>Product Options
</h2>
                    <p>Product options can be used to create product additions that can be sold with the actual product. They don’t have stock, but a SKU that links to a product. They cannot be bought without buying the corresponding product. Examples for product options are insurances or gift wrapping. Both can only exist if the actual main product is bought.

Product options are connected to the abstract product. They appear in groups, because there may be one to many product option values. Each with a unique identifier and price. On the group level, tax sets are attached to the options. One option group can be linked to many different abstract products and vice versa.
