This area is where the Online Academy source content is stored. 
This replaces the old Academy https://github.com/spryker/spryker.github.io
In this area developers can comment on pages and fix exsisting text and typos.
All new content will start out as an issue in this repository, once a location and layout of the documenta has been defined.
