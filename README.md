# Spryker Academy
The central hub for Spryker documentation, knowledge and information.

Note: Our process is built so that we do not merge pull requests, but migrate the changes manually. We do so to moderate content to see if the feedback needs to be applied somewhere else.
However, you can be credited in our documentation by stating that you wish to be mentioned when you send us feedback.
